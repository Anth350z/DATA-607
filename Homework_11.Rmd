## Reverse Engineering

The Hulu online streaming seems very well structure for which is kinda challenging on reverse engineering. some of the noticeable aspects that I see is that the recommender system is very heavy on what you are watching and then you can see that even in the subsections still recommends mostly very similar material which instead will be more interesting to see a better variety of popular content taking in consideration that subsections. we can also observe you can click on the Stop button if don't want to see that recommendation anymore which is very effective especially when you see to much content of the same topic.

## Recommendation

The Hulu company has a very nice, clean and easy interface which is very comfortable and engageable to use. 
some of the recommendations will be good to see is a "recommending YES or NOT this movie/TV Series/etc" system for this streaming media app after you finished watching and then the recommender system algorithms can use that to predict on what you liked and use it show recommendation for content like this.
Also, we can see they have 5 main menus tabs such as "Networks, TV shows, Movies, Hulu Originals, Kids" and also offer a list of more categories for example "Drama, Action, Sports and more " if you select Action it will bring everything on that section and doesn't let you query furthers for example "tab: Movies and category: Action".
when you pay for the membership that includes advertisement some its ask you what type of advertisement you would like to see, I think it should be good to ask also sometimes question that helps to make the recommender system better for example like q quick question "do you enjoy more Drama movie or Action movie?
